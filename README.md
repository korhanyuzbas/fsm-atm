## ATM system using FSM (Finite State Machine)

I've started learning Golang a few weeks ago. I've been seeking for example projects to learn it,
 but i couldn't find any good projects built with FSM.

So, I've decided to do it by myself...

**Caution:** In spite of being very simple project, it contains a lot of noobness, please don't hesitate to open issues and/or pull requests.

### TODO

- Tests
- Hardcoded values can be retrieved from user
- A lot of improvements
- More tests (like.. %100 coverage tests, maybe even %120)
